# GPT From Scratch
## Overview
The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a powerful deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture. It is primarily used for natural language understanding (NLU) and text generation (NLG). GPT is designed to predict the next word in a sequence, enabling it to generate human-like text.
## Features 🌟
✅ Transformer-Based Architecture – Uses multi-head self-attention for contextual understanding.
✅ Pre-trained on Large Datasets – Trained on massive corpora and fine-tuned for various tasks.
✅ Autoregressive Generation – Predicts words sequentially to generate coherent responses.
✅ Scalable & Efficient – Can handle complex NLP tasks with high accuracy.
## Architecture Overview 🏗
GPT is built on the Transformer decoder architecture, which consists of multiple stacked layers of:

1️⃣ Token Embedding & Positional Encoding – Converts input text into numerical representations and adds position-based context.
2️⃣ Masked Multi-Head Self-Attention – Ensures the model focuses only on previous tokens when generating text.
3️⃣ Feed-Forward Network (FFN) – Applies non-linear transformations to enhance feature representation.
4️⃣ Add & Normalize Layers – Normalizes activations to stabilize training.
5️⃣ Softmax & Output Probabilities – Generates the final word probabilities for text prediction

## 📌 How GPT Works?
Input Processing – Converts text into embeddings with positional encoding.
Masked Self-Attention – Looks only at previous words to maintain logical flow.
Feed-Forward Computation – Passes data through multiple transformer layers.
Token Prediction – Outputs the most probable next token in the sequence.
