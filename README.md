# GPT From Scratch
The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a powerful deep learning model based on the Transformer architecture. It is primarily used for natural language understanding (NLU) and text generation (NLG). GPT is designed to predict the next word in a sequence, enabling it to generate human-like text.
